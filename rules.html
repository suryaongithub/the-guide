        <p class="area"><b>creator : so basically you know the story but let me explain the story to you and also i am talking to you so basically you can spawn infinite boxes and you have to protect the tower and captain so you have to spawn boxes which would block the cannonballs shot by the officer you also have a timer you cannot just spam the boxes and you cannot create boxes too far from the cannon</b></p>
        <p class="area">creator : but dont worry if you want to just create infinite boxes without any cannon to destroy you can do that here</p> 
        <p class="area">note : this is not the actual game</p>
